Implementing a  poll creator Below is a comprehensive list of business functionalities for a **Poll Creator** system, covering **backend**, **frontend**, **poll creation**, and **poll submission**. These requirements are designed to ensure the poll creator is user-friendly, scalable, secure, and capable of meeting diverse use cases for collecting quick user feedback. The functionalities are organized by the specified categories, with an emphasis on ensuring a complete, end-to-end solution.

### 1. Backend Functionalities
The backend handles data storage, processing, security, and integrations for the poll creator system.

#### 1.1 Data Management
- **Database Schema**:
  - Store poll metadata (e.g., ID, title, description, question, options, creation date, creator ID, status).
  - Store response data (e.g., respondent ID or anonymous identifier, selected option, timestamp, IP address).
  - Support for categorization (e.g., tags like "customer feedback," "event poll").
- **CRUD Operations**:
  - Create, read, update, and delete polls and their responses.
  - Soft delete functionality to mark polls as deleted (`is_deleted`) without permanent data loss.
- **Response Storage**:
  - Store responses with metadata (e.g., geolocation, device type, submission time) while complying with privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
  - Support high-volume response storage with efficient indexing for quick retrieval.

#### 1.2 API Endpoints
- **Poll Management APIs**:
  - `POST /api/polls`: Create a new poll with question, options, and settings (e.g., anonymous, time-bound).
  - `GET /api/polls/{id}`: Retrieve poll details by ID.
  - `PUT /api/polls/{id}`: Update poll settings or content.
  - `DELETE /api/polls/{id}`: Soft delete a poll.
  - `GET /api/polls`: List all polls for a user or organization with filters (e.g., active, archived, draft).
- **Response APIs**:
  - `POST /api/polls/{id}/responses`: Submit a poll response.
  - `GET /api/polls/{id}/results`: Retrieve poll results (e.g., vote counts, percentages) with optional filters (e.g., date range, demographics).
- **Analytics APIs**:
  - `GET /api/polls/{id}/analytics`: Fetch detailed analytics (e.g., response trends, completion rates).
- **Authentication & Authorization**:
  - Secure endpoints with JWT, OAuth, or API keys.
  - Role-based access (e.g., admin can manage all polls, users can manage their own).

#### 1.3 Business Logic
- **Poll Validation**:
  - Ensure polls have a valid question and at least two options.
  - Enforce constraints (e.g., maximum number of options, character limits for question/answers).
- **Response Validation**:
  - Prevent duplicate votes (e.g., using IP address, user ID, or cookies).
  - Validate response format (e.g., selected option exists).
- **Time-Bound Polls**:
  - Automatically close polls after a specified duration or date (`scheduled_at`).
  - Trigger notifications or actions upon poll closure.
- **Anonymity Control**:
  - Support anonymous or identifiable responses based on poll settings.
  - Mask sensitive respondent data (e.g., IP address) for compliance.
- **Real-Time Updates**:
  - Use WebSockets or server-sent events to push real-time vote counts to clients (if enabled).
- **Caching**:
  - Cache poll metadata and results (`is_cacheable`) to reduce database load for high-traffic polls.
- **Scalability**:
  - Use distributed databases (e.g., PostgreSQL with sharding) or NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) for high-scale response storage.
  - Implement queue systems (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for asynchronous response processing.

#### 1.4 Security & Compliance
- **Data Encryption**:
  - Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., responses, user metadata) in transit (TLS) and at rest (AES-256).
- **Access Control**:
  - Restrict poll access based on `access_level` (e.g., public, private, organization-only).
  - Support password-protected or link-based access for private polls.
- **Compliance**:
  - Ensure GDPR/CCPA compliance for data collection, storage, and deletion.
  - Provide data export/deletion options for respondents.
- **Audit Logging**:
  - Log actions (e.g., poll creation, updates, deletions) with timestamps and user IDs (`created_by_id`, `updated_by_id`).

#### 1.5 Integrations
- **Third-Party Integrations**:
  - Integrate with email platforms (e.g., Mailchimp) for poll distribution.
  - Connect with analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics) for tracking engagement.
  - Support embedding via APIs or webhooks (e.g., post results to Slack).
- **Export Capabilities**:
  - Export poll results in CSV, JSON, or PDF formats.
  - Generate shareable reports with visualizations.

### 2. Frontend Functionalities
The frontend provides the user interface for creating, managing, and interacting with polls.

#### 2.1 User Interface
- **Dashboard**:
  - Display a list of polls with filters (e.g., active, draft, archived) and statuses (`is_active`, `is_published`).
  - Show quick stats (e.g., total responses, completion rate).
- **Responsive Design**:
  - Ensure compatibility across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) using frameworks like React or Vue.js.
  - Support WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards (e.g., screen reader support, keyboard navigation).
- **Theming**:
  - Allow customization of poll appearance (e.g., colors, fonts, logos) via `custom_css` and `custom_js`.
  - Support dark/light mode for better user experience.

#### 2.2 Poll Management
- **Poll Creation UI**:
  - Drag-and-drop interface for adding questions and options.
  - Preview mode to visualize the poll before publishing.
- **Poll Editing**:
  - Edit question, options, or settings (e.g., anonymity, time limits) before or after publishing (if allowed).
- **Poll Status Indicators**:
  - Show statuses like `is_draft`, `is_published`, `is_scheduled`, or `is_archived` with clear visual cues.
- **Embedding Options**:
  - Generate embed codes for websites, iframes, or social media.
  - Provide QR codes for offline distribution.

#### 2.3 Results Visualization
- **Real-Time Results**:
  - Display live vote counts or percentages (if enabled) using charts (e.g., bar, pie).
  - Support toggling result visibility for respondents (`is_visible`).
- **Interactive Charts**:
  - Render dynamic charts using Chart.js or D3.js for vote distribution.
  - Allow filtering by date, demographics, or response source.

  - Optimize backend queries for high-traffic polls (e.g., use indexing, caching).
  - Minimize frontend load times with lazy loading for results or charts.
- **Scalability**:
  - Support thousands of concurrent respondents without latency.
  - Use load balancers and CDNs for global accessibility.
- **Analytics**:
  - Provide insights like response rate, drop-off rate, and demographic breakdowns.
  - Support exportable reports in multiple formats (CSV, PDF).
- **Extensibility**:
  - Allow future enhancements like gamification (e.g., badges for voting) or AI-driven result analysis.

### Example Workflow
1. **Poll Creation**:
   - User logs in, navigates to the poll creator dashboard, and selects "Create Poll."
   - Enters a question, adds options, and configures settings (e.g., anonymous, 24-hour duration).
   - Saves as draft or publishes (`is_published = TRUE`).
   - Shares the poll via URL, QR code, or social media.
2. **Poll Submission**:
   - Respondent accesses the poll via a link or embedded widget.
   - Selects an option and submits (anonymous or authenticated).
   - Sees confirmation and optional results (if enabled).
3. **Backend Processing**:
   - Backend validates the response, stores it, and updates real-time vote counts.
   - Triggers notifications (e.g., email to creator) if configured.
4. **Frontend Display**:
   - Creator views real-time results on the dashboard with charts and filters.
   - Exports data or shares results with stakeholders.

### Notes
- The requirements align with the `menu_menuitem` schema provided earlier, incorporating fields like `is_active`, `is_published`, `seo_title`, `seo_description`, `tool_domain`, etc.
- If you need specific technical details (e.g., database schema, API specifications, or frontend component breakdown), let me know.
- I can also generate a sample chart (e.g., pie chart for poll results) or search X for real-world poll creator examples if desired.
