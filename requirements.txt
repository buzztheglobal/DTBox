implement the business functionality A Pregnancy Due Date Calculator is a tool designed to estimate the expected delivery date for a pregnant woman based on key input data. Below is a list of business functionalities for such a calculator, covering its core features, user interaction, and potential integrations:

Input Collection:
Allow users to input the first day of their last menstrual period (LMP) or the date of conception.
Provide an option to select the average length of the menstrual cycle (e.g., 28 days, adjustable for variations).
Include fields for additional details, such as ovulation date, if known, for higher accuracy.
Due Date Calculation:
Calculate the estimated due date (EDD) using standard medical formulas (e.g., Naegele’s Rule: LMP + 280 days, adjusted for cycle length).
Provide the estimated conception date, gestational age, and trimester milestones.
Account for variations in cycle length or irregular periods to refine the estimate.
Result Display:
Show the estimated due date prominently, along with the current gestational week and trimester.
Provide a timeline or calendar view highlighting key pregnancy milestones (e.g., end of first trimester, viability, full-term).
Display the remaining weeks/days until the due date.
Personalization:
Allow users to save their due date for future reference (e.g., via account creation or local storage).
Offer customization options, such as notifications for upcoming milestones or checkups.
Support multiple languages and regional date formats for broader accessibility.
Educational Content:
Provide information on what to expect at different stages of pregnancy (e.g., fetal development, maternal changes).
Include tips for prenatal care, nutrition, and health based on the current gestational week.
Link to credible resources or articles for further reading.
User Interface and Experience:
Ensure a simple, intuitive interface with clear input fields and minimal steps to get results.
Optimize for mobile and desktop use, with responsive design.
Include visual aids like progress bars or fetal development images to enhance engagement.
Additional Features:
Offer a printable report summarizing the due date, gestational age, and key milestones.
Provide a countdown feature to track days/weeks remaining until the due date.
Include a “share” option to send results via email or social media (e.g., for expectant parents to share with family).
