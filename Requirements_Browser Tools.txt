# Business Requirements Document: URL Shortener Service Implementation

Integrating QR code functionality into stage timer software like StageTimer (stagetimer.io) for remote control enhances accessibility and streamlines event management by allowing users to quickly access timer controls, viewer displays, or agendas via a QR code scan. Below, I’ll outline how to integrate QR code functionality for remote control and then provide the final updated business requirements incorporating this feature.

### Integrating QR Code for Remote Control of StageTimer

Based on StageTimer’s existing capabilities and general QR code integration practices, here’s how QR codes can be implemented for remote control:

1. **QR Code Generation for Controller and Viewer Links**:
   - **Functionality**: StageTimer already supports sharing timer and agenda links via QR codes for viewers and attendees to access the timer display or submit questions. Extend this to include a QR code for the controller page, which provides full access to timer management (start, stop, reset, adjust) and message creation.
   - **Implementation**: Use StageTimer’s API to generate dynamic QR codes linked to the controller page URL. The API requires an API key for authentication, which can be generated from the controller page interface.[](https://openmakers.io/product/stagetimerio/product-update-new-public-api-to-remote-control-your-timer)[](https://stagetimer.io/docs/controller/)
   - **Process**:
     - On the controller page, add a button to generate a QR code for the controller link, secured with an API key to restrict access to authorized users.
     - Use a QR code generation library (e.g., QRCode.js or a third-party service like Scanova) to create the QR code programmatically, embedding the controller URL.[](https://scanova.io/blog/qr-code-integration/)
     - Display the QR code on the controller interface or allow downloading as an image for sharing via physical media (e.g., printed on event badges) or digital channels (e.g., email, WhatsApp).

2. **Remote Control via QR Code Scan**:
   - **Access**: Authorized users (e.g., stage managers, AV professionals) scan the QR code with a mobile device or tablet to instantly access the controller page in a web browser, without manually entering the URL.
   - **Security**: Ensure the QR code links to a password-protected or API-key-secured controller page to prevent unauthorized access. StageTimer’s documentation suggests password-protected rooms are available with premium plans.[](https://stagetimer.io/docs/controller/)
   - **Actions**: From the controller page, users can remotely start/stop timers, adjust durations, send messages to the presenter’s display, and manage connected devices. QR codes can also link to specific actions (e.g., start a specific timer) using API endpoints.[](https://stagetimer.io/blog/countdown-timer-for-event-production/)

3. **Real-Time QR Code Updates**:
   - **Dynamic QR Codes**: For events requiring frequent updates (e.g., changing timers or agendas), implement dynamic QR codes that can be updated via the API without changing the physical QR code. This requires integration with a QR code management platform that supports redirects (e.g., Scanova).[](https://scanova.io/blog/qr-code-integration/)
   - **Use Case**: For example, a QR code scanned by a stage manager could initially link to the controller for the first session, then update to the next session’s controller link after the session ends.

4. **Integration with Existing Tools**:
   - **StreamDeck/Companion**: StageTimer’s API supports integration with tools like StreamDeck and Bitfocus Companion for remote control. QR codes can link to a custom StreamDeck profile configured with Companion buttons for timer actions (e.g., play, pause, next timer).[](https://stagetimer.io/)[](https://openmakers.io/product/stagetimerio/product-update-new-public-api-to-remote-control-your-timer)
   - **OBS Studio/vMix**: For events with live streaming, QR codes can link to a timer display integrated into OBS Studio or vMix, allowing remote control of the timer overlay via the API.[](https://stagetimer.io/use-cases/timer-for-video-productions/)
   - **Microsoft Teams/Zoom**: QR codes can be shared in virtual meeting platforms to allow remote presenters to access the timer or agenda, aligning with StageTimer’s guides for Teams integration.[](https://stagetimer.io/blog/)

5. **Offline Support**:
   - **Desktop App**: For events without internet access, StageTimer’s desktop app (Windows/Mac) runs a local webserver. QR codes can be generated to link to the local IP address of the controller page, accessible on the same network.[](https://stagetimer.io/)
   - **Fallback**: Ensure QR codes include a fallback URL for cloud-based access if the local network fails.

6. **User Experience Enhancements**:
   - **QR Code Placement**: Display QR codes on the controller page, event badges, or digital screens at the venue for easy scanning by authorized personnel.
   - **Instructions**: Provide clear instructions (e.g., on-screen or printed) for scanning QR codes to access the controller or viewer pages.
   - **Accessibility**: Ensure QR codes are scannable by standard QR code readers on iOS, Android, or other devices, and test compatibility with various screen sizes and lighting conditions.

7. **Technical Implementation Steps**:
   - **API Setup**: Access StageTimer’s API documentation to retrieve endpoints for controller actions (e.g., `/start-timer`, `/pause-timer`). Generate an API key from the controller page.[](https://openmakers.io/product/stagetimerio/product-update-new-public-api-to-remote-control-your-timer)[](https://stagetimer.io/blog/countdown-timer-for-event-production/)
   - **QR Code Generation**: Use a library like QRCode.js or a service like Scanova to generate QR codes embedding the controller URL with the API key. For dynamic QR codes, integrate with a platform that supports URL redirects.[](https://scanova.io/blog/qr-code-integration/)
   - **Security Configuration**: Implement API key authentication and, if needed, password protection for controller access to ensure only authorized users can control timers.
   - **Testing**: Test QR code scanning on multiple devices (e.g., iPhone, Android, tablets) to verify access to the controller page and functionality of remote control actions.
   - **Deployment**: Embed QR codes in the StageTimer interface, event materials, or digital platforms, and provide training to staff on their use.
