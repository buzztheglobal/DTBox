### Business Requirements and Functionality for Implementing "What's My IP Address"

**Business Requirements:**
1. **Accessibility**: Provide a simple, user-friendly interface accessible via web browsers and mobile devices.
2. **Accuracy**: Display the user's public IP address (IPv4 and/or IPv6) accurately.
3. **Speed**: Ensure quick response times to fetch and display the IP address.
4. **Privacy**: Avoid storing or logging user IP addresses unnecessarily to comply with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
5. **Reliability**: Ensure high availability with minimal downtime (e.g., 99.9% uptime).
6. **Security**: Use secure protocols (HTTPS) to protect data transmission and prevent tampering.
7. **Scalability**: Handle multiple simultaneous user requests without performance degradation.
8. **Cross-Platform Support**: Compatible with major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and operating systems (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android).
9. **Localization**: Support multiple languages for global accessibility.
10. **Analytics**: Track usage metrics (e.g., number of requests, geographic distribution) without compromising user privacy.

**Functionality:**
1. **IP Detection**:
   - Retrieve the user's public IP address from the server-side using HTTP headers (e.g., `X-Forwarded-For`, `Remote-Addr`) or client-side via APIs like `ipify.org` or `ifconfig.me`.
   - Support both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
2. **User Interface**:
   - Display the IP address prominently in a clean, minimalistic design.
   - Include a "Refresh" button to recheck the IP address.
   - Provide a copy-to-clipboard feature for the IP address.
3. **Additional Information**:
   - Optionally display geolocation details (e.g., country, city, ISP) using a geolocation API (e.g., `ip-api.com`).
   - Show whether the IP is static or dynamic (if detectable).
4. **Error Handling**:
   - Handle cases where the IP address cannot be retrieved (e.g., network issues, VPN usage).
   - Display user-friendly error messages.
5. **API Integration**:
   - Integrate with a reliable third-party API (e.g., `ipify.org`, `ip-api.com`) for IP detection and geolocation.
   - Cache results briefly to reduce API calls and improve performance.
6. **Responsive Design**:
   - Ensure the interface adapts to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
7. **Security Features**:
   - Use HTTPS to encrypt data transmission.
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
8. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Log errors and performance metrics for debugging and optimization.
   - Avoid logging sensitive user data like IP addresses.

1. **What's My DNS?**
   - **Purpose**: Displays the DNS servers a user’s device is using.
   - **Functionality**: Queries the DNS resolver and lists primary/secondary DNS servers, often with provider details (e.g., Google DNS, Cloudflare).
   - **Use Case**: Helps troubleshoot network issues or verify DNS settings for security (e.g., checking for DNS hijacking).

2. **What's My Browser?**
   - **Purpose**: Identifies the user’s browser, version, and operating system.
   - **Functionality**: Detects user-agent strings to display browser details, screen resolution, and plugin information.
   - **Use Case**: Useful for web developers to ensure compatibility or for users to verify browser settings.

3. **What's My Location?**
   - **Purpose**: Provides the user’s approximate geographic location.
   - **Functionality**: Uses IP-based geolocation or browser geolocation APIs to show city, region, country, and coordinates.
   - **Use Case**: Helps users verify their location for services like maps or region-locked content.

4. **What's My Internet Speed?**
   - **Purpose**: Measures the user’s internet connection speed.
   - **Functionality**: Runs download/upload speed tests and measures latency (ping) using tools like Speedtest.net or Fast.com.
   - **Use Case**: Diagnoses network performance issues or verifies ISP-provided speeds.

5. **What's My User Agent?**
   - **Purpose**: Displays the user-agent string sent by the browser.
   - **Functionality**: Shows detailed information about the browser, OS, and device type based on the user-agent header.
   - **Use Case**: Useful for developers testing websites or users checking for spoofed user agents.
