# Business Requirements Document: URL Shortener Service Implementation

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the business requirements for developing and implementing a URL shortener service. The service will allow users to convert long URLs into shorter, more manageable links that redirect to the original destination. This is aimed at improving user experience in sharing links across social media, emails, marketing campaigns, and other digital channels. The requirements consider a 360° perspective, encompassing functional, non-functional, user, security, scalability, data, integration, compliance, operational, and financial aspects to ensure a robust, sustainable solution.

### 1.2 Background
URL shorteners have become essential tools in digital marketing, analytics tracking, and content sharing. Popular examples include Bitly, TinyURL, and Google's goo.gl (now deprecated). The service will address pain points such as lengthy URLs being cumbersome, breaking in messages, or lacking tracking capabilities. It will provide value through simplicity, reliability, and insights into link performance.

### 1.3 Objectives
- Enable easy creation and management of shortened URLs.
- Provide analytics to track engagement and performance.
- Ensure high availability, security, and scalability to handle varying loads.
- Support monetization through premium features or integrations.
- Comply with global data privacy regulations.

## 2. Scope
### 2.1 In-Scope
- Core functionality: URL shortening, redirection, and basic analytics.
- User authentication and account management.
- API for integrations with third-party applications.
- Security measures against abuse.
- Scalability for up to millions of daily requests.
- Data storage and reporting.
- Mobile and web interfaces.

### 2.2 Out-of-Scope
- Custom domain hosting (e.g., branded short links like "brand.ly/abc") – to be considered in future phases.
- Advanced AI-driven features (e.g., link optimization based on user behavior).
- Physical hardware procurement (cloud-based deployment assumed).
- Integration with specific enterprise systems unless requested.

## 3. Stakeholders
- **End Users**: Individuals or businesses shortening URLs for personal, marketing, or sharing purposes.
- **Marketing Teams**: Need analytics for campaign tracking (e.g., clicks, geography, devices).
- **Developers/Integrators**: Require APIs for embedding the service in apps or websites.
- **Administrators/Operators**: Manage system health, user support, and compliance.
- **Business Owners/Executives**: Focus on revenue potential, ROI, and competitive positioning.
- **Regulators/Auditors**: Ensure compliance with laws like GDPR, CCPA.
- **Security Teams**: Handle threat detection and mitigation.

## 4. Functional Requirements
### 4.1 Core Features
- **URL Shortening**: Users input a long URL; the system generates a unique short URL (e.g., domain.com/abc123).
- **Redirection**: Short URL redirects to the original with HTTP 301/302 status.
- **Custom Aliases**: Allow users to create custom short codes (e.g., domain.com/promo) if available.
- **Link Expiration**: Option to set expiration dates or click limits for temporary links.
- **Batch Processing**: Support shortening multiple URLs at once via API or UI.

### 4.2 User Management
- **Registration/Login**: Support email, social logins (e.g., Google, X/Twitter), and SSO for enterprises.
- **Dashboard**: Users view, edit, delete, or archive their links.
- **Role-Based Access**: Free users (basic features), premium users (advanced analytics, custom domains).

### 4.3 Analytics and Reporting
- Track metrics: Clicks, unique visitors, referrers, geolocation, device type, time of day.
- Real-time dashboards and exportable reports (CSV, PDF).
- Integration with tools like Google Analytics or custom webhooks.

### 4.4 API and Integrations
- RESTful API for creating, retrieving, and analyzing short URLs.
- Webhooks for event notifications (e.g., on click thresholds).
- SDKs for popular languages (e.g., JavaScript, Python).

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
### 5.1 Performance
- Response time: < 200ms for shortening and < 100ms for redirection.
- Throughput: Handle at least 1,000 requests per second initially, scalable to 10,000+.
- Uptime: 99.99% availability with redundancy.

### 5.2 Scalability
- Horizontal scaling: Support cloud-based auto-scaling (e.g., AWS, GCP).
- Handle growth: From 100K to 10M+ daily active users without degradation.
- Data volume: Store billions of URLs with efficient querying.

### 5.3 Reliability and Maintainability
- Fault tolerance: Redundant servers, databases, and CDNs for global distribution.
- Backup and Recovery: Daily backups with < 1-hour RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and < 4-hour RTO (Recovery Time Objective).
- Monitoring: Integrate with tools like Prometheus or New Relic for alerts on errors, latency.

### 5.4 Usability
- Intuitive UI/UX: Mobile-responsive web app, accessible (WCAG 2.1 compliant).
- Multilingual support: At least English, Spanish, French initially.
- Error Handling: User-friendly messages (e.g., "URL invalid" with suggestions).

## 6. Security Requirements
- **Authentication**: Use OAuth 2.0, JWT for APIs; enforce HTTPS everywhere.
- **Data Protection**: Encrypt stored URLs and user data; anonymize analytics where possible.
- **Abuse Prevention**: Rate limiting, CAPTCHA for suspicious activity; block malicious URLs (e.g., phishing via integration with services like Google Safe Browsing).
- **Vulnerability Management**: Regular scans, OWASP compliance; handle DDoS with WAF (Web Application Firewall).
- **Access Controls**: Audit logs for all actions; least-privilege principle.

## 7. Data Requirements
- **Storage**: Use NoSQL (e.g., Redis for caching, MongoDB for persistence) for URLs; relational DB for user data.
- **Data Retention**: Links persist indefinitely unless deleted; analytics data retained for 1-2 years.
- **Privacy**: Opt-in for data collection; support data deletion requests (e.g., GDPR "right to be forgotten").
- **Analytics Data**: Aggregate insights without exposing PII.

## 8. Integration and Technical Requirements
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud-agnostic (compatible with AWS, Azure, GCP); containerized (Docker/Kubernetes).
- **Third-Party Services**: Integrate with CDNs (e.g., Cloudflare), email providers (e.g., SendGrid for notifications).
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, load, and security testing; CI/CD pipeline.
- **Deployment**: Phased rollout (MVP first: basic shortening; then analytics).

## 9. Compliance and Legal Requirements
- **Regulations**: Comply with GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA (if health-related links), and CAN-SPAM for marketing.
- **Intellectual Property**: Ensure short codes don't infringe trademarks.
- **Accessibility**: Adhere to ADA standards.
- **Audit Trails**: Log all changes for compliance audits.

## 10. Operational Requirements
- **Support**: 24/7 monitoring; tiered customer support (email, chat for premium users).
- **Training**: Documentation and tutorials for users/admins.
- **Maintenance**: Scheduled downtimes < 1% annually; auto-updates for security patches.

## 11. Financial and Business Model Requirements
- **Monetization**: Freemium model – free tier with limits (e.g., 100 links/month); premium tiers for unlimited links, advanced analytics ($5-50/month).
- **Cost Management**: Optimize for low operational costs (e.g., serverless architecture).
- **ROI Metrics**: Track user acquisition cost, lifetime value, churn rate.
- **Competitive Analysis**: Differentiate with better analytics or integrations compared to competitors.

## 12. Assumptions and Dependencies
- **Assumptions**: Users have internet access; domain name is available (e.g., short.ly).
- **Dependencies**: Reliance on cloud providers; third-party APIs (e.g., for geolocation).
- **Constraints**: Budget for development (~$100K-500K initial); timeline (3-6 months for MVP).

## 13. Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: High traffic overload – Mitigation: Implement auto-scaling and caching.
- **Risk**: Security breaches – Mitigation: Regular pentests and insurance.
- **Risk**: Low adoption – Mitigation: Marketing campaigns and user feedback loops.
- **Risk**: Legal issues (e.g., link to illegal content) – Mitigation: Automated scanning and disclaimers.

This document provides a comprehensive foundation for the URL shortener service. It should be reviewed and refined with stakeholders before proceeding to technical design and implementation.
